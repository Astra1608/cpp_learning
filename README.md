3) Project: Mind Reader Game (Guessing Game)
A beginner-level interactive C++ game where users ask up to 5 Yes/No questions to guess a secret character. After the questions, a hint is provided to make a final guess. It sharpens logical thinking and teaches how to use string searching and conditional checks.

Topics used: string, getline, tolower(), find(), bool, conditional statements, ternary operator, and interactive input/output.
